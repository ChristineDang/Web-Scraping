# Web-Scraping
ABOUT:

The Web-Scraping app lets users view and make notes on the latest news - scrape articles from The Wall Street Journal using Mongoose and Cheerio. Articles saved and notes created are saved to the Mongo database.

(NOTE: This app is currently under construction to fix the heroku hosting and upgrade the saved articles page)

HOW TO USE:

Once the deployed Heroku link has been opened, click on the "Scrape New Articles!" button in the navbar, and 20 new articles will be displayed in the body within 1-4 seconds

Users can either clear their search by clicking on the "Clear Articles!" button in the navbar, then scraping again, or they can save the articles to the saved page

Each article card contains the title of the article with it's href, a one sentence description section, and a button to save the article

On the saved articles page, users can add notes to each article
